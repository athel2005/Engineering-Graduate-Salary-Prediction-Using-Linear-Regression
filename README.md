# Engineering Salary Prediction Using Linear Regression

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict engineering
graduates' salaries based on academic, technical, and aptitude scores.
It includes full data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, model
training, evaluation, and interpretation of key features influencing
salary outcomes.

## 📌 Features

-   Data cleaning: handling missing values, duplicates, and categorical
    standardization\
-   Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations\
-   Linear Regression model training using Scikit-learn\
-   Evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R²\
-   Insights into factors affecting salary predictions

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Python**
-   **Pandas**
-   **NumPy**
-   **Scikit-learn**
-   **Matplotlib**
-   **Seaborn**
-   **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📊 Model Workflow

1.  Import and preprocess dataset\
2.  Clean and prepare features\
3.  Perform EDA and feature correlations\
4.  Train Linear Regression model\
5.  Evaluate performance metrics\
6.  Interpret feature impact


## 🚀 Outcome

A clear, interpretable regression model providing data-driven salary
predictions and insights into employability factors.
